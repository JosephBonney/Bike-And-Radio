StuntMode ReadMe

Please ensure that your MTB is on the IgnoreRaycast layer. Also make sure that air time rotation sensitivity is more than 0 in the inspector (v1.6+) . 

You may perform weight transfer movements with the keys WASD where:

	- W/S for leaning in front / back [You may also use the respective arrow keys]
	- A/D for leaning to the left / right [You may also use the respective arrow keys]

Press Space to launch up in the air (bunny hopping power has been increased for the example scenes). Press WASD to perform flips in mid air.
Try making a perfect landing in the direction of movement. Takes a bit of practice to perform a seamless stunt transition.
Have Fun!
